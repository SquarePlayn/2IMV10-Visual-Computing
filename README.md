The project for the 2IMV10 Visual Computing Project of the Technical University Eindhoven.

## Getting started
### Prerequisites
- Java 8+

### Installing
To build the software, execute `gradlew build` (or `./gradlew build` if you're not on Windows) in the project directory. 
When this is finished, the `build/libs` folder contains two `jar` files. 
The `project-full-jar-*` file can be used as a standalone executable.

## Executing
Using the handed in jar file or a self-built jar file,
execute it with java 8 or higher.
